This is a sample app that uses the 2013 version of the Ti-Navigation-Controller that I built, at
https://github.com/vuinguyen/NavController (with a couple of mods for this project).

It is a complex, master-detail app that opens on a single screen, and goes several levels deep
for some of the items in the list.

As this is an open source project, I may not have time to update this often. 
But please feel free to fork from this project and make your own improvements. 
If you do so, I'd love to hear from you (and so would the rest of my blog readers, as this would help everyone! :) )
